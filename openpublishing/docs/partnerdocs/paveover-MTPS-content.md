# Paving over your MTPS content (migration from MTPS to Open Publishing) #

If you are migrating your content from MTPS (published with PWS or the Build Sytem) to Open Publishing, you will need to pave over your old content. 

As part of the pave over operation, make sure that you set your content to NoIndex and NoFollow and promote the content again. Once this is done, the old content will be removed from the site map in the next refresh (once every sprint). Remember to do this for all your locales.

If your content is not removed from the site maps and still appear in the search results, open a bug via the [MSDNHelp portal](http://msdnhelp/) with the content ids, the locales, and when you paved over your content.

# Redirection #
Right now, MTPS does not provide automatic redirection. So we will work with you on getting your content redirected if we can. We will try to offer two ways:

1. Topic to topic redirection.
2. Grouped redirection.
